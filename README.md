# Cybersecurity Awareness Quiz

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Awareness Quiz, a web-based educational tool designed to teach key cybersecurity concepts through an interactive quiz. Hosted on GitHub Pages, this project was developed as part of an internship to enhance cybersecurity awareness.

- **Scoreboard**: Tracks top 5 scores using `localStorage`, sorted by score and timestamp.
- **Clear Scoreboard**: Button to reset all scores.
- **Styled Explanations**: Replaces alerts with a styled `<div>` for feedback, with a "Next" button.
- **Share Score**: Copies your score (e.g., "CyberHero scored 8/10") to the clipboard.
